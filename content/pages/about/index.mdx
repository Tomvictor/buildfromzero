Hi!
I am a computer programmer, Entrepreneur and Technology enthusiast lives in Kochi, India.
My primary aim is to empower the children with computer/Coding literacy.
It will help the younger generation to think logically and apply the source of truth rule in their daily life, religious beliefs (Mostly stupid fake customs),  
political and social setup. We can not drag next generation of kids with no special skills to the reality of life. Everyone should learn new skills everyday.
Every knowledge matters. Knowledge help us to navigate our life and provide a way to communicate, which otherwise will be limited to few people before the IT era.
